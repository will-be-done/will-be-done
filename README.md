This is my 5th attempt in 2 years to make task manager of my dream. And it looks like I very close to my dream!
I already use it daily, and I fairly enjoy it. Two reasons why I need it - self-hosted(I own my data),
daily planning. Hope you find something that could be useful for you too!

Top features:
1. Weekly timeline view - see multiple days as columns, plan your week visually
2. Everything drag & drop - move tasks between days, projects, categories
3. Kanban boards everywhere - each project has categories (Week/Month/Ideas/etc)
4. Horizons - organize tasks by time scope (Week/Month/Year/Someday) instead of random priority numbers
5. Repeating tasks - set up recurring tasks with flexible schedules (daily, weekly, custom patterns)
6. Multiple spaces - separate workspaces for work/personal/different projects
7. Keyboard navigation - vim-style keys (j/k) and arrows to move around fast
8. Local first - works offline, syncs back when you're online
9. Self-hosted - one docker command, no external dependencies
10. Open source
11. Custom DB with b-tree indexes - way faster than Redux or similar libs, everything runs in-memory on frontend

Coming soon:
1. Attachments and comments for tasks
2. Global search
3. More vim keybindings (beyond basic j/k navigation)
4. Calendar integration
5. Mobile-friendly UI
